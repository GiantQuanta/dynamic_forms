# DynamicForms
Dynamic Forms allows application users to build and launch complex data
collection forms. Administrators can build questionaires using built-in
or extensible data-types. Users can respond to these quesionaires and
the resulting data can be analyzed.

## Status
Currently a framework for benchmarking performance of architectures
involving polymorphic association, Single Table Inheritance, and various
backing stores.

```ruby
gem 'dynamic_forms', git:
'https://github.com/GiantQuanta/dynamic_forms.git'
